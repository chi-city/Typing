# Typing
UIC CS141 Project 3, Fall 2021

Create a typing tutor program that prompts for words to type, keeping track whether or not you
spell them correctly, within a time limit.

For this program you can choose either to type commonly misspelled words, or to type randomly
selected words from a large dictionary.  The first time you use the large dictionary all the
presented words are of length 5.  Each time after that the word length goes up by one, unless
reset.  A score is calculated from the number of words correctly spelled and typed along with the
length of time it takes.

Please refer to sample output pdf.
